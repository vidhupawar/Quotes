# Quotes Editor App

## Overview
This repository contains a simple quotes editor application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows users to add, edit, and delete quotes.

## Structure
- `/backend`: Contains all the server-side code written in Node.js with Express.js framework.
- `/frontend`: Contains all the client-side code written in React.

## Features
- Add new quotes with author names.
- Display a list of all quotes.
- Edit existing quotes.
- Delete quotes.
- UI interactions such as hover effects with icons for edit and delete actions.

## Installation and Setup
Clone this repository and follow the setup instructions in the README files within each subdirectory:
- [Backend Setup](./backend/README.md)
- [Frontend Setup](./frontend/README.md)

## Usage
Start both the backend and frontend services to interact with the application. The backend will serve the API requests from the frontend, which interacts with the MongoDB database to store the quotes data.
